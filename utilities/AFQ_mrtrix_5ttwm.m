% This is prepared to create the wmmask based on the anatomical 5tt file. 
% The problem is that if we do not have the reversed phase encoding file
% the alligment is not very good so the wmMask we are going to create it
% wont be perfect either...
% 
% Strategy;
% - Use FA > faMaskThresh to create a wmMask for seeding. 
% - Use eroded twice brainmask to clean the borders, it is usually messy
% - Use the wmMask obtained from 5tt file (anatomical) to create the mask
%   where the fibers cannot cross. 
% 
% 
% This is hte code to extract the wm only from the 5tt file
% 
% For now use the FA file to create the mask
